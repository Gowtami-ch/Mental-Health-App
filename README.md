## Introduction
>Dealing with mental health is what makes us human. But for a lot of us, it's a struggle to be open about it. Even if we are open about it, there is a global shortage of psychiatrists and lack of mental health care access in rural regions. In this context, we feel that apps can serve as a viable tool to bridge the mental health treatment gap.
Our app serves as a user feedback system for self-management and maintaining good mental health of every individual. One can assess their mental health by taking our mental health (self-assessment) test. This test gives the user’s overall mental health score on a scale of hundred and also gives the scores of their wellbeing and illbeing, physical health, relationships and belonging, self-perception etc. The users can check their daily/weekly scores and see the statistics of their scores as well. This app encourages users to maintain an emotion journal so that they can identify what is causing them to feel stressed or anxious. It also encourages the users to create a to-do list and help them in self-management. The app provides an option to read good news articles and some wholesome memes for recreation. This app can be revisited every day, to keep oneself occupied with his goals and not fall into the stress holes created by the world around him.

## User Guide

### Mental Health Self Assessment test
> Through our app users can take the mental health self-assessment test daily or weekly. This test comprises of 25 questions covering various aspects like wellbeing and illbeing, physical health, relationships and belonging, self-perception, hope and hopelessness etc. After completing the test, the app gives a detailed report of their scores in all the above stated aspects of their mental health. It also displays the stress and anxiety levels of the users. Based on these results, the users can understand in which aspects they should focus on and take care of in order to improve their mental health. The app also keeps track of the scores of the users and provides the statistics of the scores. So, the users can check on which day their score was good or bad and draw various results from these statistics.

### Emotion Journal
> Our app encourages users to maintain an emotion journal. This emotion journal allows users to record their feelings over several days or weeks and then notice patterns or trends. When the users recognize these trends, they can work to eliminate or avoid certain triggers — or focus their energy on how best to respond next time. Our app encourages the users to pause for a bit of self-reflection, so that they can identify the situation fuelling an emotion.

### To-do List
> Writing things down helps reduce stress and makes one feel more relaxed. You get a feeling of being in control of your life and actions. Our app provides a feature for the users to maintain a to-do list. This to do list will help users stay organised. The users can write all their tasks in the to-do list, so that tasks are more manageable. When they complete a task, they can cross it off from their list. This gives the users a sense of progress and achievement, something they’ll lack if they’re always rushing from one task to the next. It gives the users a sense of achievement,  and it spurs them on and motivates to keep moving forward.

### News Articles
> This app provides a lot of news articles. A good article is like a wholesome healthy meal for our brain and mental well-being. It is a well-established fact that reading articles can help the brain's cognitive functions and reduce stress and anxiety. Users can get the updates of the latest things happening around the world and keep themselves updated. Users can also search for specific news in the search bar provided.

### Memes

Memes provide a safe space to deal with depression and anxiety. Our app provides a feature to watch some wholesome memes and share with friends or relatives.
